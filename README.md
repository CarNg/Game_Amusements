# Game_Arcade
Arcade is a small game developed in Unity as part of a Games Programming assignment. The idea was to demonstrate what we learned in C# in Unity. We were asked to demonstrate a number of different skills. This included: using various game object types, event handling, appropriate use of physics and audio content, Mecanim for animation, retention and use of state variables and finally, design and implementation of a HUD, game controls and some form of AI.

All of these requirements were achieved in Arcade. The game also features ‘Turntable’, a physics game built in Unity, with save features that were not originally implemented. Other elements that appear in Arcade but not in the other games I have developed includes animation using Mecanim and the implementation of AI logic.
